# Educational Website

## Overview
Project developed for the 2024 Scientific Communication Session of Mechanics course. The main goal of this project is to serve as an introduction to kinematics and dynamics of bodies, aiming to provide students with a solid theoretical foundation while visually demonstrating the principles through two interactive mechanisms.

## Features
- ## Kinematics Theory

- ## Crank-Slider Mechanism: A detailed cinematic study including:

Identification of the mechanism's bodies.

Graphical representation of trajectories.

Visualization of velocities and accelerations at different points.

Kinematic solution for the mechanism's motion.
